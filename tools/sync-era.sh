# One-way copy of the addon's runtime files from this checkout into Classic Era on the PC, for
# testing there. Run it after edits; then /reload in game.
#
# Never a link: the CurseForge app recognises the addon by the X-Curse-Project-ID in its TOC and
# "updates" it by deleting the folder's contents. On 2026-10-23 a directory junction made that
# delete the checkout's own Media and Fonts (restored from Git). A copy can only lose itself.
#
# The copy also drops the TOC's X-Curse-Project-ID line, so the app has nothing to recognise: the
# checkout keeps it (the release packager needs it), the game does not read it.
#
# Mirrors the .pkgmeta ignore list (development files, artwork originals, unused fonts).
